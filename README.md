Hi, I’m @Alesantt, aka Alexandre, or just "Ale".
Programming/Coding is a whole new opportunity for life. A new start.
I’m currently learning Front-End/Qa, but i'm also looking to collaborate on pretty much any stuff. Since i'm beginner, i need to get experience and learn everything i can.
And you can talk with me via e-mail =)
